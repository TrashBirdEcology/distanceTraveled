# About
A package for calculating distance travelled of single- or multi-dimensional system. 

Distance travelled a variant of a distance measure (e.g. euclidean), yet differs slightly in that euclidean distances are combined (summed) *across variables* and *within* a time frame. Further, the metric is calculated as the cumulative sum over a time period (or some other dimension; e.g., space).

A description of the method is forthcoming.
